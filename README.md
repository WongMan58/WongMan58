# Who am I?

Hi, I'm WongMan58. I'm a person who loves making random software that have no benefit and games that don't really make sense

# Programming languages I use

- Python
- C/C++ (Only a little bit)

# My projects

- [Wordle Bot, a piece of software that can help you find the answer to today's wordle game](https://github.com/WongMan58/wordle-bot)
